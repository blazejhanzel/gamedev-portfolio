      <br/><br/>
      <strong>Why does samyam collect data from its apps and games?</strong> When you install and use samyam mobile applications, we can collect and process some of your data for different legitimate purposes.
      <br/><br/>
      You will find below explanations regarding the reasons why samyam may collect data and the legal bases samyam relies on in each case.
      <br/><br/>
      <strong>What data does samyam collect from its apps and games?</strong> For all the purposes listed above the data that samyam collect is limited to:
      <br/><br/>
      Your Mobile Advertising ID (Apple IDFA or Google AAID - which are technical identifiers developed by mobile operating systems for advertising purposes which remain under your control and can be reset or erased at any time in through your device settings)
      <br/><br/>
      <strong>With who may your data be shared & why?</strong> samyam do not share your personal data with third parties without your prior consent in the countries where collecting users’ consent may be required by applicable laws and regulations.
      <br/><br/>
      When you consent to the collection of data for advertising and analytics purpose, we may share the data listed above with the following categories of recipients:
      <br/><br/>
      Ad Partners: that allow us to monetize the ad inventory of our apps and provide users with free products and services.
      <br/><br/>
      Those partners usually collect data via their own tools (Software Development Kits or “SDK”). You will find a list of our partners implementing advertising SDKs through our applications and the privacy policies of their services that describe their practices and allow you to exercise your rights directly toward them hereafter:
      <br/><br/>
      Google AdMob - <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en">https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en</a>

      Adjusting your consent settings within samyam apps and games, will allow you to block the collection of data for these purposes and will de facto prevent the sharing of information with our analytics and/or advertising partners.
